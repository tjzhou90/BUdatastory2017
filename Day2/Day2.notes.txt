## Accessing Data

Sometimes we can also use 'require' instead of library
require - if you don't have the package, R will automatically install it

ggplot2 always takes dataframes.
It always deals with 2 dimensions.
aes = deals with x and y, has nothing to do with displaying, only the mapping
geom_point = deals with the display

when we want to view the data (data(mpg)), we get promise, this is lazy loading. because R has no need for the variable yet, it will not display it

%+% ONLY used in ggplot
If you already have a plot, this symbol lets you modify it.

*** Consider this when dealing with data...
Who collected it? How is it processed? Can you reproduce it?
Do you have the right to use it, cite it?
How is it accessed? Can you red it? Secure? Encrypted?

## playing with the buoy data

paste0 to directly concatenate strings together
paste requires a separator
ymd_h converts string to date time format, needs lubridate package


## Reading data files
Reading database files, as.is=T will convert characters into factors
Reading Json files, simplifyVector=T will return a dataframe instead of list
